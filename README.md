### Moviesaurus
Moviesaurus is the project that I completed as an iOS Development intern at OBSS during 2022 Summer. This project is a basically an IMDB clone.

## Features Implemented

* Localization: The application supports localization, allowing users to experience the app in their preferred language. Localization files have been added to provide translations for different languages.
* Pagination: The Movie List screen includes pagination, allowing the app to load more movies as the user scrolls.
* Search Functionality: The Movie Search screen enables users to search for movies by entering a string input. The app retrieves search results from the TMDb API and displays them to the user.
* Favorite Movies: Users can mark movies as favorites, and the app provides a separate screen where users can view and manage their favorite movies. Clicking on a favorite movie navigates to the Movie Detail screen.
* Movie Detail: The Movie Detail screen presents detailed information about a selected movie. It includes images, title, release date, ratings, budget, revenue, genres, overview, runtime, production companies, a link to the movie's homepage, and recommendations.
* Cast Details: The Cast Detail screen provides comprehensive information about a specific cast member. It displays the cast member's name, image, biography, birthday, death day, and place of birth.
* Generic Functions: Generic functions have been utilized in the project to improve code reusability and flexibility.
